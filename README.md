## üöÄ Features

- **Custom 16-bit RISC Architecture**  
  Designed to execute 14 well-defined instructions including:
  - Arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB)
  - Logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
  - Load/Store (LD, ST)
  - Control flow (BEQ, BNE, JUMP)

- **6-Stage Pipeline Architecture**  
  The processor pipeline consists of:
  1. Instruction Fetch (IF)  
  2. Instruction Decode (ID)  
  3. Register Read (RR)  
  4. Execute (EX)  
  5. Memory Access (MEM)  
  6. Write Back (WB)

- **Hazard Mitigation**
  - Implemented mechanisms to handle **data hazards** and **control hazards**.
  - Uses techniques like stalling and forwarding to ensure smooth pipeline execution.

- **Simulation & Testing**
  - Functionality verified through **testbenches**.
  - Simulated and tested using **Xilinx Vivado** to ensure performance and correctness.
